## Installation

First step is to install the helpers.

```bash
npm install konnors-ninja-keys
```

## Usage

```js
import "konnors-ninja-keys"
```

## Going Forward

These docs themselves use `konnors-ninja-keys`! However, for obvious reasons, preview examples have disabled the `cmd+k` / `ctrl+k` functionality and instead require manual activation.
